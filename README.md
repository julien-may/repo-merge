# repo-merge.sh

A simple script to **merge one Git repository into another** by placing its contents into a subdirectory while **preserving the entire commit history**.

This is useful when consolidating multiple Git projects into a single repository, creating a monorepo, or just archiving your personal contributions across various projects.


## Why?

Over time, I've accumulated many Git repositories across different projects and contexts. Some are personal experiments, others are contributions to various initiatives, and some are just old projects I want to keep around for reference.

The problem is that these repositories end up scattered across different locations - some on my local machine, some in cloud folders, some on different Git hosting services. They're not organized, not searchable, and over time I even forget what projects I worked on.

What I really want is to pull all those repositories into a single, well-organized Git repo. One folder per project, with all the commit history preserved. That way I can keep everything tidy in a single private repository that's easy to browse, search, and reference.

Thanks to services like GitHub, it's easy to store and secure private repositories. With this script, I can now consolidate everything cleanly and push it to a single private repo. For me, this is much better than having a scattered pile of backups floating around.

Hereâ€™s how I typically use it:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/acme

for repo in ~/work/*; do
  ./repo-merge.sh -s "$repo" -t ~/acme
done
```
The result is a single repository named acme, where each imported project has its own subdirectory and its full history.


## Features

- Merges any Git repo into another
- Preserves the complete commit history
- Automatically detects the default branch (e.g. `main`, `master`)
- Minimal and portable (pure Bash)

## Requirements

- [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) must be installed and available in your `$PATH`

```bash
# macOS
brew install git-filter-repo

# Manual (any OS)
curl -o /usr/local/bin/git-filter-repo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newren/git-filter-repo/main/git-filter-repo
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/git-filter-repo
```

## Usage

To merge one repository into another and place its contents in a subdirectory:

```sh
./repo-merge.sh --source <source_repo_path> --target <target_repo_path> [--dir <subdirectory>] [--verbose]
```
